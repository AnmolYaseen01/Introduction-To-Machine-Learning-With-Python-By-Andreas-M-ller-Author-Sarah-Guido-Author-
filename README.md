# Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I'll be sharing daily code exercises and projects that I'm learning from the book "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Andreas Müller and Sarah Guido.

## About the Repository

This repository serves as a learning journal where I document my progress and understanding of machine learning concepts using Python. Each day, I'll be posting code snippets, exercises, and even small projects that I work on while going through the book.

## Book Information

- **Title:** Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
- **Authors:** Andreas Müller, Sarah Guido

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized by chapters or sections of the book. Each folder corresponds to a specific part of the book, containing code examples and projects related to the material covered.

Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback! I encourage discussions, questions, and collaborations, so don't hesitate to open issues or pull requests if you have any insights or improvements to share.

## How to Navigate

1. **Chapters:** The main folders are organized by the chapters or sections of the book.
2. **Code:** Look for code snippets and examples in each folder.
3. **Projects:** Check out the projects folder for hands-on applications and practical exercises.
4. **Presentations** Check out the presentations files to view the presentations created by Anmol Yaseen, having dtailed notes of the topics studied in the book.

## Daily Updates

I will be updating this repository regularly with new code, exercises, and projects. Follow the repository to stay updated on my learning journey. Feel free to join me on this exciting adventure into the world of machine learning!

Happy coding!
